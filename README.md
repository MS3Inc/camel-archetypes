These are Maven archetypes that generate Camel/SpringBoot applications. A README pertaining to each one can be found in their respective folders. Quick links for commands to run them:
- [OpenAPI archetype](https://github.com/MS3Inc/camel-archetypes/blob/main/camel-openapi-archetype/README.md#how-do-i-run-the-archetype)
- [Scheduled archetype](https://github.com/MS3Inc/camel-archetypes/tree/main/camel-scheduled-archetype#how-do-i-run-the-archetype)

The latest releases can be found in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.ms3-inc.tavros%20archetype).

If making changes to one archetype and the changes are applicable to the others, please make the changes in both. A data comparison tool can be used to accomplish this more easily.
